# PATH -- iOS App

Picture this -- you're late to work in the morning, but can't start the day without your cup of Starbucks. 
You look for cafes via Yelp or Google Maps, but all the results are scattered around your house. If only you could
filter those results to a route! With Path, you can. Simply input your starting and ending addresses, and the app will
return cafes, restaurants, and much more all affixed to your path.
